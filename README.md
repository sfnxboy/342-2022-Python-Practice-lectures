# QC Math 342W - 2022 Python Practice lectures

This repository holds the translations for Professor Adam Kapelner's 342 Data Science via Machine Learning practice demos and labs. There are 24 practice demos, and 10 labs. I will continuously update these files, at least until the end of the Spring semester.

These notes are based off of the [Math 342W Spring **2021**](https://github.com/kapelner/QC_MATH_342W_Spring_2021) semester.

These notes were made for the [Math 342W Spring **2022**](https://github.com/kapelner/QC_MATH_342W_Spring_2022) semester.

Refer to the [setup](https://github.com/sfnxboy/342-2022-Python-Practice-lectures/blob/main/Jupyter_Setup.md) to use Jupyter Notebook via the Anaconda distribution.
